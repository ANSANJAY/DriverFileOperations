# get_user Function in Linux Kernel 🐧

`get_user` is an essential function used in the Linux kernel to safely read data from user space into kernel space. Let's deep dive into its workings, usage, and nuances.

## Overview 📜

The kernel provides a set of functions to safely interact with user space memory. Direct access without these functions can be unsafe and might lead to unpredictable system behavior.

**`get_user`** is one of these safety functions, primarily used for reading simple variables.

## Syntax 🖊️

```c
get_user(variable, user_space_pointer);
```

- `variable`: This is the kernel-space variable where you wish to store the value read from user space.
- `user_space_pointer`: A pointer to the variable in user space from which you wish to read.

## When to use get_user? 🤔

- 🎯 Primarily for simple data types like `char`, `int`, `long`, etc.
- 🚫 Not suitable for complex/larger data types, e.g., structures. For such data types, use `copy_from_user`.

## Example 📖

Imagine you want to read an integer provided by a user space program:

```c
int value;
get_user(value, &userspace_int);
```

Here, `userspace_int` is a pointer to an integer in user space, and `value` is the kernel space integer where the data will be stored after the call.

## Interview Questions 🤓

1. **Q:** What is the main purpose of the `get_user` function in the Linux kernel?  
   **A:** The main purpose of the `get_user` function is to safely read data from user space into kernel space. It's used to ensure there's no direct and unsafe access to user memory.

2. **Q:** Can you use `get_user` to copy a structure from user space to kernel space?  
   **A:** No, `get_user` is designed for simple types like `char` and `int`. For larger or complex data types, such as structures, one should use the `copy_from_user` function.

3. **Q:** Why is direct access to user space memory discouraged in kernel space?  
   **A:** Direct access to user space memory from the kernel is discouraged because it can lead to unpredictable system behavior, crashes, and potential security vulnerabilities. The kernel provides functions like `get_user` and `copy_from_user` to safely facilitate this interaction.
