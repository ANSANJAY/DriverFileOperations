## Kernel Code:

## Does not work

1. **Imports and Declarations**:
    - The custom struct `abc` from "mystruct.h" is included.
    - `kernel_struct` is an instance of this `abc` struct, which the kernel will use for reading and writing.

2. **File Operations**:
    - **`device_read`**: 
        - Copies the `kernel_struct` into a userspace buffer.
        - Logs the values of `kernel_struct`.
    - **`device_write`**: 
        - Copies data from a userspace buffer into `kernel_struct`.
        - Logs the values of `kernel_struct`.

## User Code:

1. **Declarations**:
    - An instance `user_struct` of type `abc` is declared.

2. **Main Program**:
    - Memory is dynamically allocated for `user_struct.str` and it's initialized with the string "hello".
    - `user_struct.i` is set to 10.
    - The program opens the character device `/dev/mystruct`.
    - The contents of `user_struct` are written to the device.
    - The program waits (using `getchar()`) for the user to press any key and then closes the device.

## Custom Struct:

- This struct `abc` consists of:
    - An integer `i`.
    - A pointer to a character `str`.

## Understanding Dynamic Memory:

- In the user code, dynamic memory allocation is used (`malloc`) to allocate memory for the `str` member of `user_struct`.
- In the kernel code, however, there is a notable risk: When the userspace passes a pointer (`str` inside `user_struct`) to the kernel, the kernel is not directly dereferencing this pointer to get the associated string. This is good because dereferencing userspace pointers in kernel space can lead to errors or security risks. Instead, the `copy_from_user` function is used to safely copy data from userspace to kernelspace.
- Remember, while `user_struct` and `kernel_struct` share the same structure, they exist in two different memory spaces (user space and kernel space). Hence the need to safely copy data between them.

## Conclusion:

From this code, we indeed learn about dynamic memory allocation in userspace. We also understand the importance of safely copying data between the kernel and userspace, especially when structures with pointers are involved. The code demonstrates how data in structures can be sent between user programs and the kernel, emphasizing safety precautions.
